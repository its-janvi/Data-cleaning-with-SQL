# Data-cleaning-with-SQL
This repository contains a data cleaning project in SQL, focusing on the `layoffs.csv` dataset. The project demonstrates the process of importing data into a SQL database and performing various cleaning operations to ensure data quality and consistency.

## How It Works

The data cleaning process involves several steps:

1. **Importing Data**: The `layoffs.csv` dataset is imported into a SQL database to prepare it for cleaning and analysis.

2. **Remove Duplicates**: Duplicate records in the dataset are identified and removed to maintain data integrity.

3. **Standardize Data**: Data standardization ensures consistency in the format and structure of data across different records. This step may include converting data to a consistent case, format, or unit of measurement.

4. **Handling Null or Blank Values**: Null or blank values in the dataset are identified and handled by either replacing them with appropriate values or removing them from the dataset, depending on the context.

5. **Remove Columns**: Unnecessary columns in the dataset are identified and removed to simplify analysis and reduce clutter.

6. **Generate New Dataset**: After performing the cleaning operations, a new dataset is obtained with the necessary changes applied.

## Usage

To replicate the data cleaning process:

1. **Set Up SQL Environment**: Ensure you have a SQL environment set up.

2. **Import Dataset**: Import the `layoffs.csv` dataset into your SQL database.

3. **Execute SQL Scripts**: Execute the SQL scripts provided in this repository, following the order of steps outlined above.
